<h1>Assesment 1</h1>
<h1>profile</h1>
<p style> My name is nima I'm from the Doncaster area and I do Bachelor of IT at RMIT University. I am interested in blockchain and I'm an investor in Ada Etherum and polygon and I want to use IT to one day in the near future develop something related to blockchain or make a meaningfull impact on the cybersecurity industry. I am also interested in MMA and plan to compete to challenge myself after finishing University.</p>
<h1>my interest in IT</h1>
<p>I chose to study IT in university as I've always have had a fascination with IT since i was a child. It all started around the age of 8 with the video game "Grand Theft Auto". This game is Notorious for hacks and modifications. This made me motivated to learn how to modify the game in the way i see fit, therefore, making me interested in IT. I chose to apply for the Bachelor of IT in Rmit as the IT degree is regarded as the best in the industry. RMIT is also more accessible for me as I can go there by one bus. The community of RMIT looked more suitable for someone like me. I expect to learn skills related to coding programming, cybersecurity, and the business side of computers. </p>

<h1>my ideal job</h1>
<p>My ideal job is to become a Cybersecurity specialist at a credible company. Cybersecurity jobs have never been in more demand than 2021 as more people have access to the internet and more companies have adopted cloud computing into their systems. An example of a Specialist job currently listed in Australia is Cyber Security specialist role in Hays technology located in Sydney. It is expected for a specialist to focus on the day-to-day security operations of the business. A specialist is expected to work on projects which upgrade the security system, policies, and processes by identifying the problems and vulnerabilities and figuring out solutions that can fix them. The qualifications needed for this position are :</p>
<ul>At least 4 years' experience in a Cyber Security role </ul>
<ul>Demonstrate strong technical security knowledge (i.e. vulnerabilities, incident detection, Windows/Linux OS, etc.)</ul>
<ul>Experience with Industry Frameworks and Standards: ISO27001/2 and NIST. </ul>
<ul>Good Understanding of cyber security operations within an enterprise environment. </ul>
<ul>Familiarity with security frameworks (e.g NIST Cybersecurity framework) and risk management methodologies. </ul>
<ul>Excellent written and verbal communication skills and exceptional stakeholder engagement and technical documentation skills. </ul>
<p>Working as a cybersecurity specialist is attractive to me as I enjoy looking for problems and solving them. This role requires very high-level analytical skills, prior experience in Cybersecurity areas, the ability to use Microsoft's ATP suite, and outstanding customer service and stakeholder management skills. Degrees required for a cybersecurity job are bachelor of Information technology, computer science, or information assurance. I am planning to become qualified for my ideal job by completing my Information technology degree and at the same time working at jobs that require teamwork and high customer service. After completing my degree, I plan to start with an entry-level security job and work my way to the more high-level Roles by 2030.</p>



<h1>project idea </h1>
<p>project idea: Libertas is a decentralized social media platform that cannot be controlled by any individual or group as it is controlled by the votes of the majority of content creators on the Cardano blockchain.</p>
<p>Censorship and lack of freedom of speech have been a real problem on social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook. Since most platforms produce capital by advertisement deals, to make a profit they need to block some of the contents that are not considered family-friendly or promote a certain political view that is not popular with the masses, to look more appealing to a larger audience. The censorship can lead to these platform's loss of market capitalization as the result of their platform coming off as disingenuine to the audience. Therefore, so many users do not feel safe on the platform and feel like their information is shared with advertisement companies and they will feel like they do not have a choice over what content they would like to consume. Libertas will solve this problem by using a blockchain token system to produce capital for creators. the project's capital raising system will be built on Cardano's smart contract system which means the consensus will be achieved by the proof of stake system. Proof of stake (PoS) protocols are a class of consensus mechanisms for blockchains that work by selecting validators in proportion to their quantity of holdings in the associated cryptocurrency. Unlike a "proof of work" protocol, PoS systems do not incentivize extreme amounts of energy consumption. Proof of work will lower the energy consumption by 99.9% on a large scale and makes the transactions faster. The use of the Decentralised token system will cause the users to feel freer while using the platform and the foundation platform being built on the blockchain also will make sure the content posted on the platform is based on what the majority prefers rather than what the advertisement companies prefer as the decentralization removes the control away from advertisement companies. As the content creators do not need to change their ways of producing content for these companies to run ads on their work, this will improve productivity and creativity. </p>
<p>"In January 2021, Australia had 20.5 million social media users with social penetration in Australia is currently at 80%." as more people use social media platforms it is essential to develop a Social media platform that is energy efficient, cannot be manipulated, fast, sustainable and secure. A platform that runs itself can make the users have more trust in the platform and choose to spend more time on Libertas compare to for example Instagram that can share your information with advertisement companies or the Government. The Token system can also encourage more activity from users as the users will be able to use smart contracts to have business deals. There will also be an NFT system for artists and companies that they can use to trade their digital artworks with LBTS(Libertas) tokens. This will attract more engagement to the platform as marketing will be easier for artists and companies such as Disney. the users are rewarded with tokens based on the number of interactions they get with their content. the bigger the platform gets the higher the value of tokens get as there is a limited supply of 37000000 tokens available. The platform gets updates with the approval of the top 1000 users based on engagements per post. this model can still be considered decentralized as the top creators represent the majority of the audience. The permission to add or burn tokens can also be authorized by the same system. burning more tokens causes a shock to supply which causes the value of token/USD to increase. there will be an automated system that will make sure the images, videos, songs, and NFTs posted on the platform will also not have any illegal content in them. the same system has been used on other platforms such as Google however Libertas improve on this by making the system decentralized as the flagged items will be sent to verified users to double-check the content and will reward them with tokens.</p>
<p>The Libertas platform will be built on the blockchain ecosystem of Cardano using Smart contracts. The
Cardano ecosystem after the "Alonzo" Upgrades will be able to process 2.5 million transactions per second which is what will be needed for the Libertas platform as all the transactions can make the platform slow and congested if the servers cannot handle the problem. Also, Cardano is efficient with energy which makes it even more ideal to investors. the actual apps of Libertas platform will also be built with Python same to other social media apps such as Instagram, Pinterest, and Reddit. Python can be the best program to write the apps on as it is more productive compare to programs such as C++ and Java. </p>
<p> for Libertas to achieve everything it sets out to achieve the project must be built by someone with Elite blockchain knowledge and skills. If the project is not built flawlessly it can lead to other competitors rebuilding what Libertas has and improve on it. It is also important that the app is built by a Python specialist. The app has to be functional, simple with an easy Interface. having a well-designed app can make a lot of difference as there is a lot of competitors with the same products, an example of this can be Instagram taking market capitalization from Facebook for simply being the easier app to use.</p>
<p>If Libertas achieve its goals and successfully build a fully decentralized platform with its token system, not only it will lead to more variety of content because of lack of censorship, it can also lead to a more secure form of social media and at the same time use less amount of data and energy for the payments that the content creators receive based on the Engagement they get on the website. If this Idea is adopted successfully it will cause a revolution in social media and can change the way social media is perceived. following the success of Libertas other projects such as streaming services and music platforms can be built on Libertas and in long term, the Project can be the center of entertainment.</p>
